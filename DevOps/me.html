Hello, I'm Cedric.<br />

I've always been pasionate about understanding how things work: I wrote my first program at 10; learned C and C++ at 14; and started my own IT company at 26.<br />
<br />
I have a rich professional career of almost 20 years during which I sometimes had the opportunity to extend my knowledge in DevOps and System administration.<br />
<br />
These articles illustrate how infrastructure administration is an interal part of an Agile strategy.
